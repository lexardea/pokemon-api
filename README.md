=== BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THIS PROJECT ===
Using vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, create a web page that does the following:
    - asks the user to type a Pokemon character into a textbox, then submit
    - returns the character's name and image to the webpage

=== DESCRIPTION OF HTML ===
I created a basic web page with a title, instructions, input text box, submit button, and display section.
I linked to a separate CSS stylesheet to style the website, and to a separate JavaScript file to perform the API pull.
I used element ids in HTML to connect user behavior (clicking submit button) with display of information (from API pull) using Javascript.

=== DESRIPTION OF JAVASCRIPT ===
I created an async function that takes the user's input and uses it to find the corresponding Pokemon character's name and image from PokeAPI. To take the user's input, I added an event listener to the submit button and defined the user's input as a variable in JavaScript. 

I used inner HTML to return the character name and image to the webpage.
